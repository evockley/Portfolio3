                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>For a Bootcamp project, a team of two fellow designers and myself were tasked with redesigning The
                    User Experience of a non profit website of our choice. We chose Una Mesa because we liked the local
                    nature of the organization and felt that a UI redesign would help show off their work to their
                    community.</p>
                <h4>What I learned</h4>
                <p>An exercize in panic taught me to thoroughly comb through a site when redeisgning an
                    existing interface and to verify that information architecture is completely solid before moving
                    forward. Read on to learn more.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>We interviewed 5 potential users, noted observations and participant quotes in Miro and created
                    affinity map.
                    Trends emerged around the amount of text on the screen, confusion about the org's mission, and
                    lacking and confusing information hierarchy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>The effect of the existing UI, information architecture, hierarchy, and lack of visuals was a blow to
                    the credibility of the Una Mesa brand among interview participants. One interviewee described the
                    site as a "Link Farm." Without an easily findable Mission Statement, this sentiment was only
                    exacerbated.

                    Sharon, a high school English teacher who just moved to Palo Alto, is a community do-gooder and goes

                    of time, it's important to her to actively care for her community.
                </p>

                <p>Her experience as a donor and volunteer to various organizations have taught her that as trusting as
                    she would like to be, there are some sketchy non profits, so she approaches new organizations with
                    caution.

                    because
                    she wants to teach her kids from a young age how to participate and help others.</p>
                <p>Because she's new to the area, she spends some time Googling to find a credible
                    local organization.</p>
                <p>Sharon comes across Una Mesa. She's impressed that they seem to have a lot of
                    local impact and partner with other non profits.
                    She quickly decides to donate and send an email offering her
                    time.</p>

        <h4>Information Architecture</h4>

            <div class="col-lg-6 una-mesa-IA">
                <p>At first the Information Architecture appeared very simple to us. Like most non profits, Una Mesa
                    seeks donations, shares projects they've worked on, and offers pages dedicated to their
                    personnel
                    and their mission statement. We <span>thought</span> that of all the work needed on the site,
                    the Information Architecture was one of
                    its stronger aspects. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 una-mesa-IA">
                <p>However,
                    we missed an innocuous little menu item: "Projects1," which is only visible on one page of the
                    site.
                    This link led to an entirely different iteration of a Projects page which included several more
                    projects.
                    It also explained some of the relationships around the community that Una Mesa culitivates. We
                    needed a quick fix.

                <p>We were lucky that we caught the miss early enough to piviot some of our designs. We had originally
                    anitipated creating one main projects page that would link out to information about
                    individual projects. As we pivoted to accomodate more information, I explored how we might iterate

                <p>We conducted a handful of A/B tests to determine which iteration of a hero image and button to use.
                    We found that the donate button we designed was getting attention, but not in a good way. Users
                    found it abrasive, so we worked a little bit better with our color palette.</p>

                <p>I noticed during the research phase that most non profits focus on photos of people. This observation
                    was also supported by our User Interviews which suggested that a lack of imagery was not only poor
                    visual design, but also ineffective branding. Therefore, I prioritized getting as much imagery on
                    the site as
                    possible.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>In addition to photos of people, I wanted to incorporate logos of partners where possible in order to
                    support Una Mesa's credibility.</p>

                <p>Rewriting copy was also an extremely high priority to help Una Mesa connect with its potential
                    audience.</p>

                    Una Mesa to present our findings. </p>
