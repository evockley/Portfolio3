                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    At the height of the Great Resignation, Beela, a Swedish nonprofit helping women and nonbinary
                    immigrants
                    get into tech, asked Tech Fleet to help improve the way they served this community.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Millions around the world recalibrated their careers, but Beela stakeholders weren’t seeing enough
                    growth or engagement in their community. Several touchpoints—a podcast, mentorship, and
                    newsletter—weren't attracting new users.

                </p>
                <p>Our task was to examine career changers’ experience with Beela and ideate concepts to improve the
                    nonprofit’s services and convert more users to their mentorship program.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Solution</h3>

                <p>
                    We created a dedicated Slack
                    community with several channels, a way for new career changers to start comparing career paths, and
                    a three-pronged feature on the home page giving users what they need at the beginning, middle, and
                    end of their career transition journey.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Before I joined the project, a Phase 1 Tech Fleet team set out to learn who makes up Beela’s community.
                Here are some high-level Phase 1 findings:

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="beelaBackgroundQuestions">
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ1">
                <h4>Who are they?</h4>
                <p>The typical Beela user is a female immigrant to Sweden. She is highly educated, but not yet employed
                    in tech. She thinks there are more opportunities in tech that don’t rely on Swedish language skills.
                    Gender equity it important.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ2">
                <h4>What is their immigration story?</h4>
                <p>She’s moved to Sweden with a partner, and does not have children. Her Swedish is OK, but not great.
                    This has resulted in career challenges, cultural barriers, and lack of a support system.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ3">
                <h4>What does their tech transition look like?</h4>
                <p>She’s interested in tech for personal fulfillment and job benefits. But she doesn’t know where to
                    start, lacks industry knowledge, and has limited resources. She doubts herself and doesn’t feel like
                    she belongs—in tech or in Sweden.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ4">
                <h4>Why do they join Beela?</h4>
                <p>Beela shows up on her social media and seems interesting because of its mission and as a way to
                    learn and make social connections. While she knows about some of the resources, she does not
                    frequently use them.

                    As a result of this workshop, I researched and presented potential nonprofit
                    revenue models for Beela to consider. Different models rely to varying degrees on support from
                    individuals,

                <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What we learned:</span>


                    Beela is committed to providing free services to users. That meant they would need to base their
                    fundraising on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such
                    as placement rates, conversion rates, number of members and duration of membership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earning KPIs like
                    these would allow Beela to make a more compelling case to potential donors

                The main user need that Beela serves is the root of this tree: career transitioners want to find a
                job in tech. The subsequent levels of branches are
