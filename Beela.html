            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>
                At the height of the Great Resignation, Beela, a Swedish nonprofit helping women and non-binary
                immigrants
                get into tech, asked Tech Fleet to help improve the way they served their members.
            </p>
            <p>As millions of people around the world recalibrated their careers, a future in the tech industry looked
                promising, yet daunting. Beela provided several touch points through this journey—a podcast, a
                mentorship
                program, a newsletter—but wasn’t seeing the growth or engagement they wanted. </p>
            <p>
                Our task was to examine career-changers’ experience with Beela and ideate concepts to improve the
                nonprofit’s services and convert more users to their mentorship program. We created a dedicated Slack
                community with several channels, a way for new career changers to start comparing career paths, and a
                three-pronged feature on the homepage giving users what they need at the beginning, middle, and end of
                their
                career transition journey.
            </p>

                    <li>
                        I joined the project for Phase 2, where we
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                synthesized Phase 1 research
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                defined the opportunity space
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                and ideated and tested solutions
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My role on the team was as a UX Researcher. However, Tech Fleet maintains a flexible structure,
                        so I
                        did some Design and Strategy work as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We ran six 1-week sprints, each with a different goal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Beela’s ultra-niche target audience made access to ideal interview subjects difficult.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tech Fleet Apprenticeships are a 10 hour per week commitment. We frequently worked asynchronously
                    throughout the day, but synchronous work time was hard to come by.

                looks
                like, and why they join Beela. Here are some high-level findings from a survey distributed by Phase
                1:

            <p>Phase 1 research uncovered a lot of user needs. In order to do the most effective and useful work

                we began Phase 2 with an outcomes workshop.</p>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Why we did this:</span>
                Focusing our efforts on one business goal allowed us to target our user-centered research and design

                    As a result of this workshop, I researched and presented a handful of possible nonprofit
                    revenue models for Beela to consider. Different models relied on support from individuals,
                    companies,
                    governments, and former benefactors to varying degrees. The unifying trait of the various models?
                    Results.
                </p>
                <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What We Learned:</span>
                    The workshop resulted in a clear understanding that we needed to help Beela generate revenue. This
                    was a
                    challenge because of Beela’s commitment to provide free services to users.

                    Beela would need to base their fundraising on Key Performance Indicators that spoke to their
                    success,
                    such
                    as placement rates, conversion rates, number of members, duration of membership, etc.
