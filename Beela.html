            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>
                At the height of the Great Resignation, Beela, a Swedish nonprofit helping women and non-binary
                immigrants
                get into tech, asked Tech Fleet to help improve the way they served their members.
            </p>
            <p>As millions around the world recalibrated their careers, a future in the tech industry looked
                promising, yet daunting. Beela provided several touch points through this journey—a podcast, a
                mentorship
                program, a newsletter—but wasn’t seeing the growth or engagement they wanted. </p>
            <p>
                Our task was to examine career-changers’ experience with Beela and ideate concepts to improve the
                nonprofit’s services and convert more users to their mentorship program. We created a dedicated Slack
                community with several channels, a way for new career changers to start comparing career paths, and a
                three-pronged feature on the homepage giving users what they need at the beginning, middle, and end of
                their
                career transition journey.

                            We met the Beela Stakeholders in Miro and asked them to individually create stickies with:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Their priorities for Beela</li>
                            <li>Their most important business outcomes</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>Next, we asked them to connect their priorities to the business outcome those priorities would

            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Revenue Models:</span>
                As a result of this workshop, I researched and presented a handful of possible nonprofit
                revenue models for Beela to consider. Different models relied on support from individuals,
                companies,
                governments, and former benefactors to varying degrees. The unifying trait of the models?
                Results.
            </p>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What We Learned:</span>
                The workshop resulted in a clear understanding that we needed to help Beela generate revenue. This
                was a
                challenge because of Beela’s commitment to provide free services to users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beela would need to base their fundraising on Key Performance Indicators that spoke to their
                success,
                such
                as placement rates, conversion rates, number of members, duration of membership, etc.

                In addition to a survey, Phase 1 conducted several interviews. We affinity mapped the findings,
                identified pain points, and turned them into business opportunities. Once the data was organized, we
                asked stakeholders to prioritize the opportunities we presented.

            <p>This framework helped combine user and business goals. The root of the tree is the main need Beela
                addresses: career transitioners want to find a job in tech. The subsequent levels of branches are
                distinct opportunity areas that help users meet that goal, each with its own set of supporting
                opportunities. </p>
