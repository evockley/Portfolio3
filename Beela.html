                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    At the height of the Great Resignation, Beela, a Swedish nonprofit helping women and non-binary
                    immigrants
                    get into tech, asked Tech Fleet to help improve the way they served their members.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Millions around the world recalibrated their careers, but Beela wasn’t seeing the growth or
                    engagement they wanted. The provided several touch points through the career changing journey—a
                    podcast, a mentorship program, a newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>Our task was to examine career-changers’ experience with Beela and ideate concepts to improve the
                    nonprofit’s services and convert more users to their mentorship program.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Solution</h3>

                <p>
                    We created a dedicated Slack
                    community with several channels, a way for new career changers to start comparing career paths, and
                    a
                    three-pronged feature on the homepage giving users what they need at the beginning, middle, and end
                    of
                    their
                    career transition journey.

            <p>In Phase 1, Tech Fleet set out to learn who makes up Beela’s community, what their journey into tech
                looks
                like, and why they join Beela. Here are some high-level findings from a survey distributed by Phase
                1:

        <div class="beelaBackgroundQuestions">


            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ1">
                <h4>Who are they?</h4>
                <p>The Typical Beela user is a female immigrant to Sweden. She’s making the transition to tech, but
                    despite being highly educated, she’s is not employed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ2">
                <h4>What does their immigration journey look like?</h4>
                <p>She’s moved to Sweden with a partner, and does not have children. Her Swedish is OK, but not great.
                    This has resulted in career challenges, cultural barriers, and lack of a support system.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ3">
                <h4>What does their journey into tech look like?</h4>
                <p>She’s interested in tech for personal fulfillment and career benefits, but fewer language challenges
                    and gender equity are equally important. The hurdles she faces in her career change include knowing
                    where to start, lacking industry knowledge, limited resources, self-doubt, and lack of belonging.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="beelaBackgroundQ4">
                <h4>Why do they join Beela?</h4>
                <p>Beela shows up on her social media and seems interesting because of its mission and as a way to
                    learn and make social connections. While she knows about some of the resources, she does not
                    frequently use them.

                As a result of this workshop, I researched and presented a handful of possible nonprofit
                revenue models for Beela to consider. Different models relied on support from individuals,
                companies,
                governments, and former benefactors to varying degrees. The unifying trait of the models?
                Results.

            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What We Learned:</span>
                The workshop resulted in a clear understanding that we needed to help Beela generate revenue. This
                was a
                challenge because of Beela’s commitment to provide free services to users.

                Beela would need to base their fundraising on Key Performance Indicators that spoke to their
                success,
                such
                as placement rates, conversion rates, number of members, duration of membership, etc.

                In addition to a survey, Phase 1 conducted several interviews. We affinity mapped the findings,
                identified pain points, and turned them into business opportunities. Once the data was organized, we
                asked stakeholders to prioritize the opportunities we presented.

            <p>We followed Google Design Sprint methodology to develop a high level service blueprint. To do that, we
                mapped, brainstormed, sketched, and voted on ideas. </p>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Why we did this:</span> Originally, our goal for the week was to
                create a
                testable prototype for the first prioritized branch of the Opportunity Solution Tree: I need help
                understanding and navigating the tech transition process. However, as we sketched solutions, we found
                that a
                service blueprint was a better deliverable than a prototype at this stage. </p>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What I did:</span> "How Might We..." questions, sketching, voting on

        <div class="projectCopy">
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Brainstorm:</span> First, we created a bunch of “How
                Might We…” questions and grouped similar stickies. 12 distinct categories emerged. We voted first on
                what we thought was the most important theme to focus on, and then on the most important question within
                that theme to arrive at our design challenge: </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Map:</span> With a design challenge identified, we created a (really)
                rough journey map of a simple use case of

            <p>We highlighted what we thought
                was the most important step in the process for us to work on (find ways to engage or absorb
                information).</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Sketch:</span> We tackled this design challenge asynchronously in two
                meetups based on team availability. To structure
                our time, we used the <a href="https://dpan.co/2018/04/27/the-6-1-1-sketching-session/"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">6-1-1 model.</a>
            </p>
            <p>My sketches focused on ways to get users from point A to point B. I used strategies like a progress bar,
                a checklist, and navigation tabs to allow users to see the various pieces of information related to each
                step.</p>

            <p>As we talked through our sketches, we took notes on the UI components we described. It was more important
                for
                us to think about what the UI in these sketches was doing than how it looked.</p>

            <p>
                We realized that despite
                very different layouts, <span style="background-color: #F9717128; padding: 0 .2rem">the
                    team had several different versions of visualized steps of the transition
