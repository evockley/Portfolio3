                    <h3>What is This?</h3>
                    <p>For years, Men’s fashion, tailoring, and custom clothing have been on a growth
                        trajectory.
                        This
                        App
                        redesign is a solo passion project that updates an existing order system for
                        salespeople.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using the existing interface, custom clothing orders can take as long as 90 minutes to
                        submit. I
                        knew
                        this problem intimately because I led the department that used the system. The order
                        system
                        was
                        a
                        negative touchpoint for users which ultimately led to a negative customer experience,
                        too.
                    </p>

                    <h5>What I learned</h5>
                    <p>This project challenged me to pivot from designing for a desktop to an iPad: I learned
                        that even my “failed” iterations can be resurrected in unforseen circumstances.</p>

                <h5>The Problem</h5>
                <p>Custom clothing salespeople have an antiquated order system that is cumbersome, confusing, and
                    difficult to
                    use. Contextual inquiry has shown that it can take as long as 90 minues to submit a single
                    order. </p>
                <p>The frustrating experience effetively disincentivizes users from making sales in the department,
                    thereby
                    preventing the company to capitalize on its investment as anticipated.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h5>The Challenge</h5>
                <p>I had to retain the many details associated with custom clothing while allowing users to complete
                    their tasks quickly, easily, and accurately.</p>
                <h5>The Solution</h5>
                <p>A highly organized, graphic apprach to order input, designed with speed, ease, and mobile
                    technology in mind. </p>

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h5>Contextual Inquiry</h5>
                <p>I knew how these users behaved based on a year of contextual inquiry. Working with them as team lead
                    gave
                    me good insight to their problems and the effects on the business. But I still didn’t know their
                    inner
                    monologue.</p>
                <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                <p>I conducted interviews with three users to uncover their thoughts, feelings, motivations, and pain
                    points. </p>
                <h5>Insights</h5>
                <p>Interviews taught me that users felt demotivated and stressed by the application. The excessive time
                    it
                    took to submit orders and the unintuitive interface felt like a punishment for making sales.</p>
                <p>Imagine how that affected sales.</p>

                <p>Quentin, a veteran custom clothing salesperson, met a prospective client, Jonathan, at a wine tasting
                    event. Jonathan came in a few weeks later and spent a couple of hours shopping around and getting
                    fitted
                    for a new jacket. He mentioned that he needed a wardrobe overhaul as he had just lost a lot of
                    weight.
                </p>
                <p>Quentin wanted to get this order right because he takes pride in his work, but also because there
                    were
                    multiple sales on the line.</p>

                <h5>Wireframe</h5>
                <p>Between the time I began the project and this wireframe, the company purchased iPads for each
                    employee. Now, rather than going to a back office and entering orders, users were expected to
                    enter orders on their mobile devices.</p>
                <p>This presented a new set of problems. In addition to the challenging interface, users needed to
                    interact with it on a device with a smaller screen (no, it wasn’t responsive design), and with
                    added disctractions to their workflow.</p>
                <p>I needed to come up with a new solution.</p>

                <h5>Pivot</h5>
                <p>Luckily, my sketches included something that sort of looked like tappable cards, so I adapted that
                    approach for an iPad. Now users were able to tap plus and minus icons to increase or decrease a
                    measurement. </p>
                <p>The most used alterations are on the first page, and users needing more obscure alteration can find
                    them tucked away in tabs using standard industy language: Posture, Circumference, and Length.</p>

                <p>I’ll implement what I learned from usability tests to clear up a few issues with this version. After
                    that,
                    I’ll keep working on the project to introduce some features that will address anticipated needs:
                    what happens if a customer orders two jackets in the same purchase? What if there are 5 shirts that
                    are all styled different using the same fit? What happens if a fabric is sold out?</p>

                <p>These are all questions to be adressed in subsequent iterations so these users can have a great
                    experience with their workflow.
